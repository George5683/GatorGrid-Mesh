# GatorGrid

GatorGrid is a multifunctional software solution designed for the Raspberry Pi Pico W by UF students to create a mesh network with wireless communication. It provides a low-cost, open-source alternative to existing mesh network solutions like ESP-WIFI-MESH and Zigbee by enabling seamless Wi-Fi-based communication between multiple nodes. The design uses two Pico W's per node in the network The project aims to ensure reliable message relay, even in case of node failures, making it ideal for individuals and organizations needing decentralized communication in remote or disaster-affected areas. GatorGrid focuses on accessibility, scalability, and real-time data transmission.
